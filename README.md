# action-prediction
Data preprocessing + CNN model for my graduation project. The results of the work are related to the pose estimation and automatic determination of the beginning of an action performed by a person. The work was aimed at improving control systems for industrial applications of exoskeletons, designed to increase human strength due to the external frame.
